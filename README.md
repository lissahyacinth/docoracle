# Documentation Oracle
Not the documentation you want, but the documentation you deserve.


## What this is
An opinionated documentation builder to provide a consistent documentation experience between projects. 


## What this isn't
A replacement for quickstarts, guides, introductory posts, and tutorials. 

## Features
* Automatically create useful documentation with Python
* Deploy using GitHub Pages, or as a searchable application
* Version Comparison, with change detection
* Link between all packages you use, not just the package you're building
* Offline if you need, online if you'd like to share


## Usage
```bash
> python3 -m docoracle {path_to_module}
```
